### Functionalities added

This project was built from scratch and here's the steps taken to achieve the end version

- Set up of the project with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files.
- Since all book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, we created a function to the script that can take user‚Äôs input and store the new book objects into an array.
- Wrote a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.
- Added a ‚ÄúNEW BOOK‚Äù button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title,  number of pages, whether it‚Äôs been read and anything else you might want.
- Added a button on each book‚Äôs display to remove the book from the library.
- Added a button on each book‚Äôs display to change its read status.
